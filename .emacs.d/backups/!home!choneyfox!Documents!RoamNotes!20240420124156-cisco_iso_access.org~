* Operating Systems
All devices require an operating system. The portion of the OS that interacts with hardware is called the kernal. The portion that the user interacts with is the shell. The user can interact with the shell via a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI).

When using a CLI a user interacts with the shell in a text-based environment by entering commands.

* GUI
Windows, Android, macOS and KDE use a GUI. This means you have a mouse and click on stuff and they are more approchable.
However they are not always able to provide all the features available with the CLI. GUIs can also crash and are not as efficient as CLI interfaces and therefore network devices are usually access through a CLI.

The family of operating systems on Cisco devices is called Internetwork Operating System (IOS).

* Access Methods
A switch will work by default and does not have to configured to operate. But you oftentimes still need to configure special settings.

Here is a table with methods to access a switches IOS:
