All devices that participate in network communication are called hosts.
They can be end devices, for example a PC or phone.
They can also be networking devices for example a switch or router.
And all hosts are identified through an IP address.

End devices are also often called clients. They have a client software like firefox, FireZilla, Spotify or something like that and through the magic of internet they request information like emails, videos, websites or femboy memes from a server that runs a server software for example Apache or VSFTPD.
